	Use:   "sync",
	Short: "Sync JSON workflows to n8n instance",
	Long: `Sync command takes JSON workflow files from a specified directory 
and synchronizes them with your n8n instance. For example:

n8n-cli workflows sync --directory workflows/

This will take all JSON workflow files from workflows directory and 
upload them to the n8n instance specified in your environment configuration.

The command will:
1. Process all JSON files in the specified directory
2. For each workflow file:
   - If the workflow ID exists and is found on the n8n instance, it will update it
   - If the workflow doesn't exist or has no ID, it will create a new workflow
   - If the original workflow has "active": true, it will activate the workflow`,
