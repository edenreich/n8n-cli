# n8n-cli

A simple n8n cli to sync workflows from Github to n8n using GitOps

## Motivation

Currently, the official n8n cli is not very straightforward to use. Even running n8n --help throws a bunch of errors.

This cli is a simple rest client for the OpenAPI spec provided by n8n. The initial goal is to have a good way to sync workflows from Github to n8n using GitOps.
